# Crop-Image
Cropping image by using mouse with opencv

first seen at: https://www.life2coding.com/crop-image-using-mouse-click-movement-python/  , 
than found this 'classified' version at ... Sorry, i don't know where (github ?)

the scripts you find here are not the original files from Marco Knabe, 
i have destroyed his work by my way of learning python

please consider, this is only my fun project

store some pictures in folder 'project/media'

run script

select 'region of interest' with mouse

	range ok, than hit ESCape
	wrong region, than click close - cross top right
	you get a new chance
this area will be saved in folder 'project/cropped'
